Several college's in India  do not have a proper alumni network whereas other nations such as UK and the US have proper fully functioning rich and large alumni networks. So we aim on resolving this issue by providing a web application for the colleges and directorate to keep a track on the alumni.  Our web application helps us to establish a communication between the alumni and under graduates. Since the alumni are spread throughout the world this helps the undergrads to progress drastically both personally and professionally. It provides better guidance to the grads. It also helps by connecting the alumni and the current graduate student with a chat like system for them to get to know each other and help each other out. This also helps the alumni to keep track of all the ongoing events in their alma mater.
